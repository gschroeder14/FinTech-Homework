# Homework One - Robinhood

## Overview & Origin
* Robinhood Markets Inc. is a financial service company that allows for commission free trades of stocks and ETFs on its mobile app.
* The company was founded in April 2013 by two former Stanford roommates, Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt.
* The founders wanted to make open up trading to the younger demographics by creating a trading app that was free of commission based trades and other fees. The subscription model has also allowed for instant deposits and access to early/late period trades. They got their idea from when they two were selling trading software to Wall Street firms and realized the inequality in trading fees between the average person and the big players.
* Due to the company being free to use and trade the question of how do they make money often arrises? 
    * 1. The first way that they make money is off of intrest... this is the intrest off of useres uninvested funds within their account, intrest off of Margin loans, as well as rebates and routing fees
    * 2. The second way is there Premium Gold subscription... this allows for a number of other types of trading activities like margin trading, early/late trades, option trading and more.

## Business Activites
* This is where Robinhood has the competitive advantage over all other trading platforms. The no trading fees allowed Robinhood to be the forfront of disruptive technology in finacial services as no other platform offered this before and is now slowly forcing other companies to do the same. Robinhood leveled the playing feild for retail traders not only with no fees but also with fractional trading.

## Recommendation
* If i wan an advisor to this company I would suggest that they start offering advanced resources and industry teachers on their platform. I think that this could be very beneficial to the targeted demographic of new/inexperienced traders.The company could even monotize this as a part of their subscription Robinhood Gold.
* Depending on how they go about this technology, they could use anything from AI advisors to help come up with answers or machine learning to pick new topics that might be of intrest to the user.
* The use of this kind of technology would be useful for mitigating costs of live personel while supplying the 'students' with day to day education.
